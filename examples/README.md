## Examples and tutorials

This directory contains examples that show how to set up Bayesian networks
and perform inference in them. 

The subfolders in `tutorials` contain step-by-step instructions
as Rmarkdown, pdf, and html files to create simple Bayesian networks along
with explanations of the concepts, functions and the general workflow.

The subfolders in `paper` contain the Bayesian network examples described in
the paper *Nuclear data evaluation with Bayesian networks* available on
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10322).
Due to the higher complexity of these Bayesian networks, it is certainly easier
to start with the examples in the `tutorials` folder.
